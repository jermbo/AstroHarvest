# üîó Modular Roadmap Integration Guide

## Overview

This guide explains how to integrate the four modular roadmaps into a cohesive development strategy. Each roadmap can be developed independently, but they work together to create the complete AstroHarvest experience.

**Goal**: Provide clear guidance on how to combine roadmaps for maximum flexibility and development efficiency.

## üîó Integration Points & Dependencies

### MVP Core Loop ‚Üí Bots & Progression

**Integration Point**: Bot system uses existing crop/plot system

- **Data Structures**: Crop definitions, plot management, economy system
- **APIs**: Plot planting, harvesting, resource management
- **UI Components**: Farm view, inventory system, market interface

### Bots & Progression ‚Üí Jobs & NPCs

**Integration Point**: Job system manages bot tasks

- **Data Structures**: Bot definitions, task assignments, automation workflows
- **APIs**: Bot task assignment, automation control, efficiency tracking
- **UI Components**: Job board interface, bot management, task scheduling

### Jobs & NPCs ‚Üí Storyline & Narrative

**Integration Point**: Story system uses NPC interactions

- **Data Structures**: NPC definitions, relationship tracking, community events
- **APIs**: NPC interactions, dialogue system, community development
- **UI Components**: Dialogue interface, story progression, character development

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Integration Strategy

### Data Architecture

- **Shared Data Structures**: Common interfaces for all systems
- **Modular Components**: Independent systems that can be combined
- **API Design**: Clean interfaces between different roadmaps
- **State Management**: Centralized game state with modular updates

### Code Organization

- **Modular Structure**: Each roadmap has its own code modules
- **Shared Utilities**: Common functions and utilities
- **Interface Contracts**: Clear APIs between different systems
- **Testing Strategy**: Independent testing for each roadmap

### Performance Considerations

- **Lazy Loading**: Load roadmap features only when needed
- **Memory Management**: Efficient resource usage across systems
- **Rendering Optimization**: Optimize for multiple system interactions
- **Battery Efficiency**: Minimize impact of complex systems
