## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Review the Backlog

Start by reading through each file to understand the scope and requirements:

- **Technical Architecture** - Understand the system design
- **Core Loop Mechanics** - Understand the gameplay experience
- **Version 0.1.0** - Start with the foundation

### 2. Set Up Development Environment

- Set up Pixi.js project with TypeScript
- Configure build system and development tools
- Set up testing and validation framework

### 3. Begin Implementation

- Start with versions/v0.1.0-basic-loop.md tasks
- Use systems/dev-tools-system.md for testing and debugging
- Validate each component against systems/success-metrics.md

### 4. Iterate and Improve

- Test with real players
- Measure against success metrics
- Iterate based on feedback and data

## üìä Success Criteria

### Technical Goals

- 60fps on mobile devices
- <3 seconds initial load
- Full offline functionality
- <5% crash rate

### Player Experience Goals

- 70%+ return after first day
- 5-10 minute average session length
- 80%+ tutorial completion rate
- Positive core loop feedback

### Game Balance Goals

- 1.5-2x profit margins on crops
- 2+ hour offline rewards
- Clear progression path
- Satisfying unlock progression

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Tools

### Dev Tools System

- **Resource Management**: Add/remove credits, seeds, materials
- **Time Manipulation**: Speed up, slow down, or skip timers
- **State Inspection**: View and modify game state
- **Save Management**: Export/import save files
- **Testing Tools**: Scenario testing and validation

### Monitoring and Analytics

- **Performance Monitoring**: Frame rate, load times, battery usage
- **Player Behavior**: Session length, progression, retention
- **Game Balance**: Economic health, progression rates
- **Error Tracking**: Crash rates, error frequency

## üîÑ Iteration Process

### Daily Development
