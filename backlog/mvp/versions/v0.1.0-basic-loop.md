# ðŸš€ Version 0.1.0: Basic Loop + Dev Tools

## Overview

**Goal**: Get the fundamental loop working with powerful dev tools
**Timeline**: 2-3 weeks
**Target**: Working, playable idle farming game

## Core Features

### 1. Single Plot System

- **Single plot** that you can click to plant
- **One crop type** (Quantum Blueberry - 5 minute growth)
- **Basic timer system** with offline progress
- **Simple harvest** â†’ get credits
- **Basic market** â†’ buy seeds with credits
- **Save/load system** â†’ game remembers progress

### 2. Dev Tools Console

- **Game-specific debugging** and testing interface
- **Seed Management**: Add/remove seeds instantly
- **Time Manipulation**: Speed up/slow down growth timers
- **Resource Control**: Add/remove credits and materials
- **State Inspection**: View and modify game state

## Technical Implementation

### Core Systems

- Pixi.js setup with TypeScript
- Basic game loop with delta time
- Simple state management
- IndexedDB for persistence
- Basic timer resolution system
- **Dev Tools System** â†’ In-game debugging interface

### Data Structures

- **Crop System**: Plots, growth timers, harvest states
- **Economy System**: Credits, prices, market interface
- **Save System**: Game state persistence

## Success Criteria

### Core Loop

- [ ] You can plant a seed
- [ ] Crop grows over time (5 minutes)
- [ ] You can harvest when ready
- [ ] You earn credits from harvest
- [ ] You can buy more seeds with credits
- [ ] Game remembers your progress

### Dev Tools

- [ ] Dev tools help with testing and development
- [ ] Can manipulate time and resources
- [ ] Can inspect and modify game state
- [ ] Tools are accessible and intuitive

## Deliverable

Working idle farming loop with dev tools

## Next Steps

1. Set up Pixi.js project structure
2. Implement single plot planting system
3. Create Quantum Blueberry crop with 5-minute timer
4. Build basic harvest and credit system
5. Implement simple market interface
6. Add save/load functionality
7. Create dev tools console
8. Test and validate core loop

## Dependencies

- None - This is the foundation

## Integration Points

- **Bots & Progression**: Uses crop/plot system
- **Jobs & NPCs**: Uses economy and progression systems
- **Storyline**: Uses progression and unlock systems
