# ðŸš€ Version 0.2.0: Loop Enhancement

## Overview

**Goal**: Make the loop more engaging and satisfying
**Timeline**: 2-3 weeks
**Target**: Satisfying, engaging loop

## Core Features

### 1. Expanded Farming

- **3x3 plot grid** â†’ expand the operation
- **Visual growth stages** (seed â†’ sprout â†’ growing â†’ ready)
- **Progress indicators** (timers, visual progress bars)
- **Audio/visual feedback** (particle effects, sounds)
- **Simple progression** (unlock 2nd crop type)

### 2. Enhanced Experience

- **Multiple plots** to manage
- **Visual feedback** for every action
- **Satisfying harvest** experience
- **Clear progress indicators**
- **Unlock new content** through play

## Technical Implementation

### Core Systems

- Sprite management system
- Animation system for growth stages
- Audio system for feedback
- Particle effects system
- Basic progression system

### Data Structures

- **Plot Grid System**: 3x3 grid management
- **Visual System**: Growth stages, animations, effects
- **Audio System**: Sound effects and feedback
- **Progression System**: XP, levels, unlocks

## Success Criteria

### Visual Enhancement

- [ ] Multiple plots to manage
- [ ] Visual feedback for every action
- [ ] Satisfying harvest experience
- [ ] Clear progress indicators
- [ ] Unlock new content through play

### Technical Requirements

- [ ] Smooth animations and transitions
- [ ] Audio feedback for all actions
- [ ] Particle effects for key moments
- [ ] Progress indicators are clear and accurate
- [ ] Progression system works reliably

## Deliverable

Satisfying, engaging loop

## Next Steps

1. Implement 3x3 plot grid system
2. Create visual growth stages for crops
3. Add progress indicators and timers
4. Implement audio feedback system
5. Create particle effects for actions
6. Build basic progression system
7. Add second crop type (Strawboids)
8. Test and validate enhanced loop

## Dependencies

- **Version 0.1.0** must be complete
- Basic loop and dev tools working

## Integration Points

- **Version 0.3.0**: Uses enhanced visual and audio systems
- **Bots & Progression**: Uses progression system
- **Jobs & NPCs**: Uses enhanced farming system
