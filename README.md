# üåå AstroHarvest: A Sci-Fi Idle Farming Game

**AstroHarvest** is a web-based idle farming game that combines the cozy charm of _Stardew Valley_, the farming loop of _Farmville_, and the absurd humor of _Futurama_.

Your grandfather, Dr. Zephyr Vex, is retiring and passing his agricultural research lab on to you to keep it in the family. Restore the aging facility, learn from your grandfather's mentorship, and help the New Eden colony achieve food security. Manage an advanced agricultural research lab: repairing circuits, restoring power systems, growing crops in vertical pods, building specialized bots, and selling goods to the local market. Designed for **short, chill play sessions (5‚Äì10 minutes)**, the game rewards players who return later to harvest their crops and collect crafted items.

## üå± Core Gameplay Loop

1. **Lab Maintenance & Repair** ‚Üí Fix broken circuits, replace burnt-out light bulbs, unclog nutrient tubes, and repair damaged equipment to gather raw materials.
2. **Research & Development** ‚Üí Research new bot types and farm technologies. Unlock higher pod levels and environmental systems.
3. **Manual Farming (Early Game)** ‚Üí Plant seeds in vertical growing pods. Water crops across multiple levels. Harvest mature crops manually.
4. **Bot Construction & Automation** ‚Üí Start with HELIX (Administrative Bot) as your central hub for research and management. Build specialized farming bots for different tasks. Automate planting, watering, and harvesting. Manage bot energy and maintenance.
5. **Idle Growth & Environmental Control** ‚Üí Crops grow in real-world time. Growth speed depends on crop type, watering, and environmental conditions.
6. **Craft** ‚Üí
   - **Construction Crafting**: Build bio-processors, synthesis units, and advanced machines.
   - **Production Crafting**: Use those machines to turn crops into higher-value scientific goods.
7. **Sell / Trade** ‚Üí Convert goods into credits at the Intergalactic Market.
8. **Lab Expansion & Room Unlocking** ‚Üí Build new dome rooms, unlock specialized lab sections, and eventually expand to other planets.

## Side Goals for the App

The tide is shifting in the world of development, with AI advancements making a significant impact. As a developer, I'm curious about what this means for my craft and career. This project is an exploration into "Vibe Coding", its significance, practicality, and potential to change software development as we know it.

I want to gain insight into how coding assistants work, how they can be integrated into our workflow, and whether they'll make me more capable or redundant. By diving deeper into this technology, I'm aiming to stay ahead of the curve and unlock its full potential, which will ultimately benefit my own projects, including an idle game I've been wanting to build for a long time now.
