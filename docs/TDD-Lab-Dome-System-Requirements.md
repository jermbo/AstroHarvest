# Lab Dome System Requirements

## Problem Statement

Players need a sci-fi-appropriate environment that feels authentic and integrated with the farming mechanics. The current "outdoor farm" concept doesn't align with the vertical farming, bot automation, and environmental control systems. A lab/dome system provides the perfect sci-fi setting for advanced agricultural technology.
