# Game Balance & Progression Design

## Balance Philosophy

**"Satisfying Progression with Meaningful Choices"** - Every decision should feel impactful, every session should yield progress, and players should always have multiple viable strategies to pursue.

## Core Balance Principles

### 1. **Session Value Guarantee**

- Every 5-minute session provides meaningful progress
- Players never feel like they've wasted time
- Multiple paths to advancement available at any time

### 2. **Risk vs Reward Scaling**

- Higher investment (time/materials) = higher potential returns
- Multiple risk levels available simultaneously
- No single "optimal" strategy dominates

### 3. **Exponential Growth with Diminishing Returns**

- Costs scale exponentially to prevent infinite growth
- Benefits scale logarithmically to maintain challenge
- Always something new to unlock or improve

## Progression Curve Design

### Early Game (0-30 minutes)

**Goal**: Hook players with immediate satisfaction and clear progress

#### Session Structure

- **5-minute crops**: Quantum Blueberries, Strawboids
- **Immediate feedback**: Plant → Wait 5 minutes → Harvest → Profit
- **Simple decisions**: Which crop to plant, when to water
- **Clear goals**: Buy first tool, build first station

#### Balance Targets

- **First harvest**: Within 2 minutes of starting
- **First profit**: 3-5 credits from first harvest
- **First tool purchase**: Within 15 minutes
- **First station build**: Within 30 minutes

#### Progression Gates

- **Plot 1-3**: Unlocked by default
- **Plot 4-6**: Cost 20, 40, 80 credits respectively
- **Basic Tools**: HoeBot-9000 (25 credits), Watering Can (15 credits)
- **First Station**: Jam Barrel (wood×8, stone×4, minerals×2)

### Mid Game (30 minutes - 2 hours)

**Goal**: Introduce complexity and strategic depth

#### Session Structure

- **Mixed timers**: 5m, 30m, 45m, 60m crops available
- **Crafting introduction**: Production vs raw selling decisions
- **Resource management**: Wood, stone, minerals become important
- **Station expansion**: Multiple crafting stations available

#### Balance Targets

- **Crafting ROI**: 1.6-2.2x better than raw selling

### Resource Economy

#### Material Sources

- **Wood**: Clearing branches (1-3 per action)
- **Stone**: Breaking rocks (1-2 per action)
- **Minerals**: Mining nodes (1 per action) + Starter Miner (1 per hour)

#### Material Usage

- **Construction**: 8-12 wood, 4-12 stone, 2-8 minerals per station
- **Tool Upgrades**: 5-15 materials per upgrade
- **Plot Improvements**: 10-20 materials per plot enhancement

## Progression Mathematics

### Exponential Scaling Formulas

#### Plot Cost Formula

```
Cost(n) = 20 × 2^(n-4)
Where n = plot number (4-9 for MVP)
```

#### Station Cost Formula

```
Cost(station, count) = BaseCost × (1.2)^(count-1)
Where count = number of stations of this type
```

#### Crop Yield Formula

```
Yield = BaseYield × (1 + WaterBonus × WaterStacks)
Where WaterBonus = 0.15-0.20, WaterStacks = 0-3
```
