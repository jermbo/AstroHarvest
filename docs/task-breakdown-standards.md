# Task Breakdown Standards

## Overview

This document establishes the standards for breaking down user stories into actionable development tasks. Task breakdown should translate user story requirements into clear, focused work items that developers can estimate, assign, and complete independently.

## Purpose of Task Breakdown

Task breakdown serves to:
- Convert user story requirements into actionable development work
- Enable accurate estimation and sprint planning
- Provide clear ownership and accountability for work items
- Track progress at a granular level
- Identify dependencies and blockers early
- Facilitate parallel development when possible

## Task Structure

### Required Components

Each task must include the following sections:

#### 1. Task Title
- **Format**: `[Task ID] - Clear, action-oriented description`
- **Example**: `T-001 - Create dashboard API endpoint for user preferences`

#### 2. Task Description
- Brief explanation of what needs to be accomplished
- Should be understandable by any team member
- Focus on the "what" not the "how"

#### 3. Related User Story
- Reference to the parent user story (e.g., "US-001")
- Specific requirement or AC numbers this task addresses

#### 4. Task Phases
- Break complex tasks into sequential phases (Phase 1, Phase 2, etc.)
- Each phase should have clear acceptance criteria
- Each phase should have its own status tracking
- Phases enable better progress tracking and handoffs

#### 5. Acceptance Criteria
- Clear, testable criteria for overall task completion
- Should complement phase-specific criteria
- Include both functional and non-functional requirements

#### 6. Effort Estimate
- Time estimate in hours or story points
- Brief justification for the estimate

#### 7. Dependencies
- Other tasks that must be completed first
- External dependencies (APIs, design assets, etc.)

#### 8. Definition of Done
- Technical completion criteria
- Testing requirements
- Documentation requirements

#### 9. Status Tracking
- Current task status and ownership
- Important dates and milestones
- Blockers and progress notes

## Status Management

### Task Status Values
- **Not Started**: Task is defined but not yet assigned or started
- **In Progress**: Task is actively being worked on
- **Code Review**: Implementation complete, awaiting peer review
- **Testing**: Code review passed, task is being tested
- **Blocked**: Task cannot proceed due to dependencies or issues
- **Done**: Task is completed and meets all acceptance criteria
- **Cancelled**: Task is no longer needed (with justification)

### Task Ownership
- **Assigned To**: Person currently responsible for completing the task
- Assignment may change as task progresses or workload shifts

## Task Categories

Tasks are organized into two primary categories:

### Implementation Tasks
Focus on building the actual functionality described in the user story. These tasks create the features, components, APIs, and integrations needed to meet the requirements.

**Common Implementation Task Types:**
- Frontend component development
- Backend API development
- Database schema changes
- UI/UX implementation
- Integration development
- Infrastructure setup

### Testing Tasks
Focus on validating that the implementation works correctly and meets all acceptance criteria. These tasks ensure quality and reliability of the delivered functionality.

**Common Testing Task Types:**
- Unit test development
- Integration test development
- End-to-end test scenarios
- Performance testing
- Accessibility testing
- Security testing

## Task File Organization

Tasks should be organized into separate files by category:

### Implementation Tasks File
- **Filename**: `[PBI-XXX]-implementation-tasks.md`
- **Purpose**: Contains all tasks related to building functionality
- **Focus**: Development, configuration, and setup work

### Testing Tasks File
- **Filename**: `[PBI-XXX]-testing-tasks.md`
- **Purpose**: Contains all tasks related to testing and validation
- **Focus**: Quality assurance, test automation, and verification

### User Story File
- **Filename**: `[PBI-XXX]-user-story.md`
- **Purpose**: Contains the user story with requirements and acceptance criteria
- **Focus**: Business requirements and user value

## Task Subcategories

### Implementation Tasks
- **Frontend Tasks**: UI component development, user interaction implementation, state management
- **Backend Tasks**: API endpoint development, business logic implementation, data validation
- **Integration Tasks**: Frontend-backend integration, third-party service integration
- **Infrastructure Tasks**: Environment setup, deployment configuration, monitoring setup
- **Documentation Tasks**: API documentation, technical documentation updates

### Testing Tasks
- **Unit Testing Tasks**: Component-level and function-level test development
- **Integration Testing Tasks**: Cross-system and API integration test development
- **End-to-End Testing Tasks**: Full user workflow test scenarios
- **Performance Testing Tasks**: Load testing, response time validation
- **Accessibility Testing Tasks**: WCAG compliance validation, screen reader testing
- **Security Testing Tasks**: Authentication, authorization, and data protection testing

## Task Writing Guidelines

### Keep Tasks Focused
- Each task should have a single, clear objective
- Avoid combining multiple unrelated activities
- Tasks should be completable by one person

### Make Tasks Independent
- Minimize dependencies between tasks when possible
- Clearly identify unavoidable dependencies
- Enable parallel development where feasible

### Size Tasks Appropriately
- Tasks should be completable within 1-3 days
- Break down larger work into smaller, manageable tasks
- Consider complexity, not just time

### Use Clear, Action-Oriented Language
- Start with action verbs (Create, Implement, Update, Configure)
- Be specific about what needs to be built
- Avoid vague or ambiguous descriptions

### Include Technical Context
- Reference specific components, files, or systems
- Include relevant technical constraints
- Mention integration points or dependencies

## Task Breakdown Process

### 1. Analyze User Story
- Review all requirements and acceptance criteria
- Identify major functional areas
- Consider technical architecture and dependencies

### 2. Identify Task Categories
- Separate frontend, backend, and integration work
- Identify infrastructure or setup tasks
- Consider testing and documentation needs

### 3. Break Down by Functionality
- Create tasks for each major requirement
- Consider sub-requirements and edge cases
- Ensure each AC is covered by one or more tasks

### 4. Review and Refine
- Check for missing tasks or gaps
- Verify task independence and sizing
- Confirm all requirements are addressed

### 5. Estimate and Prioritize
- Provide effort estimates for each task
- Identify critical path and dependencies
- Determine task priority and sequence

## Best Practices

### Task Sizing
- **Small (1-4 hours)**: Simple implementations, minor updates
- **Medium (4-8 hours)**: Moderate complexity features, integrations
- **Large (8-16 hours)**: Complex features, significant changes
- **Extra Large (16+ hours)**: Should be broken down further

### Dependency Management
- Clearly document all dependencies
- Consider creating setup or foundation tasks first
- Plan for parallel development opportunities

### Quality Considerations
- Include testing tasks for complex functionality
- Consider performance and security requirements
- Plan for code review and documentation updates

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Tasks too large**: Break down work that takes more than 2-3 days
- **Unclear descriptions**: Ensure any developer can understand the task
- **Missing dependencies**: Identify all prerequisites upfront
- **Incomplete coverage**: Ensure all user story requirements are addressed
- **Technical jargon**: Keep descriptions accessible to all team members
