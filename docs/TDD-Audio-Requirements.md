# Audio Design Requirements

## Audio Philosophy

**"Cosmic Farm Ambiance"** - Audio must blend the familiar sounds of farming with subtle sci-fi elements. Sound should enhance the cozy, satisfying feeling of progress while maintaining the quirky Futurama-inspired humor.

## Core Audio Requirements

### Audio Design Principles

- **Satisfaction Over Realism**: Exaggerated, satisfying sound effects over realistic ones
- **Layered Complexity**: Simple base sounds that can be layered for complexity
- **Accessibility First**: All audio cues must have visual alternatives
- **Performance Optimized**: Audio must not impact game performance

### Sound Effect Requirements

#### Farming Action Sounds

- **Planting Sounds**: Satisfying "thud" or "plop" when seeds hit soil
- **Watering Sounds**: Gentle water splash with subtle sci-fi enhancement
- **Harvesting Sounds**: Satisfying "pop" or "pluck" with sparkle effects
- **Tool Usage**: Distinctive sounds for each tool (HoeBot, watering can, axe, pickaxe)

#### Crafting Sounds

- **Construction Sounds**: Hammering and building sounds for station construction
- **Production Sounds**: Distinctive sounds for each crafting station (barrel bubbling, oven crackling, etc.)
- **Completion Sounds**: Satisfying "ding" or chime when crafts complete
- **Progress Sounds**: Subtle ongoing sounds during long crafting processes

#### UI Interaction Sounds

- **Button Sounds**: Soft clicks for primary buttons, lighter taps for secondary
- **Navigation Sounds**: Gentle "swish" for screen transitions
- **Confirmation Sounds**: Positive chimes for successful actions
- **Error Sounds**: Gentle "buzz" (not harsh or alarming)

#### Notification Sounds

- **Achievement Sounds**: Triumphant but short fanfare for milestones
- **Warning Sounds**: Soft "beep" with visual flash for warnings
- **Success Sounds**: Pleasant "ding" with sparkle effects
- **Completion Sounds**: Distinctive sounds for different types of completion

### Music System Requirements

#### Background Music

- **Main Theme**: Upbeat, optimistic electronic with organic elements
- **Menu Music**: Calmer, ambient version of main theme
- **Achievement Music**: Triumphant fanfare for major milestones
- **Seamless Loops**: Music must loop without jarring restarts

#### Music Implementation Requirements

- **Volume Control**: Separate sliders for music, SFX, and master volume

### Performance Requirements

- **Audio Pooling**: Reuse audio objects to prevent memory leaks
- **Lazy Loading**: Load audio files on demand
- **Compression**: Optimize file sizes for web delivery
- **Caching**: Cache frequently used sounds in memory

### Browser Compatibility Requirements

- **Web Audio API**: Primary audio engine with HTML5 fallback
- **Autoplay Policies**: Respect browser autoplay restrictions
- **User Interaction**: Require user interaction before playing audio
- **Fallback Support**: Graceful degradation for older browsers

## Mobile Considerations

### Battery Optimization

- **Minimal Background Processing**: Reduce audio processing when possible
- **Efficient Playback**: Optimize audio playback for battery life
- **Background Pause**: Pause audio when app is backgrounded
- **Power Management**: Reduce audio quality on low battery

### Data Usage

- **Compressed Files**: Minimize data usage for mobile networks

- **Offline Support**: Cache essential audio files locally
- **Network Awareness**: Adjust audio quality based on connection

### Touch Integration

- **Haptic Feedback**: Vibration for button presses and actions
- **Touch Sounds**: Audio feedback for touch interactions
- **Gesture Audio**: Sound effects for swipe and other gestures
- **Accessibility**: Audio cues for accessibility features

## Audio Design Patterns

### Feedback Loop Requirements

- **Action → Sound → Visual → Satisfaction**: Every action must complete this loop
- **Consistent Audio Language**: Same sound family for similar actions
- **Layered Complexity**: Base sound + enhancement + variation
- **Contextual Adaptation**: Sounds change based on game state

### Emotional Design Requirements

- **Satisfaction**: Exaggerated, rewarding sounds for all actions
- **Progress**: Audio that makes waiting feel productive
- **Discovery**: Special sounds for new unlocks and achievements
- **Completion**: Celebratory audio for milestones and goals

## Quality Assurance Requirements
